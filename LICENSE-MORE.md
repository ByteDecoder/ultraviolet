# BASS LICENSE

Copyright (c) 1999-2013 Un4seen Developments Ltd. All rights reserved.

BASS is free for non-commercial use. If you are a non-commercial entity
(eg. an individual) and you are not making any money from your product
(through sales/advertising/etc), then you can use BASS in it for free.
If you wish to use BASS in commercial products, then please also see the
next section.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BASS IS PROVIDED
"AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
AND/OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE AUTHORS SHALL NOT BE HELD
LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE USE OF BASS. YOU USE
BASS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Usage of BASS indicates that you agree to the above conditions.

All trademarks and other registered names contained in the BASS
package are the property of their respective owners.

Commercial licensing
--------------------
BASS is available for use in your commercial products. The licence
types available are as follows:

SHAREWARE: Allows the usage of BASS in an unlimited number of your
shareware ("try before you buy") products, which must sell for no more
than 40 Euros each. Non-shareware products are also permitted, but the
product price limit is 10 Euros in that case. The price limit can be
raised by purchasing duplicate licences, eg. 2 licences doubles it. If
you are an individual (not a corporation) making and selling your own
software, this is the licence for you. 

SINGLE COMMERCIAL: Allows the usage of BASS in one commercial product.

UNLIMITED COMMERCIAL: Allows the usage of BASS in an unlimited number
of your commercial products. This licence is on a per-site basis, eg.
if you are creating products with BASS at 2 sites/locations, then 2
licences are required.

Please note the products must be end-user products, eg. not components
used by other products. 

These licences only cover your own software, not the publishing of
other's software. If you publish other's software, its developers (or
the software itself) will need to be licensed to use BASS.

These licences are on a per-platform basis, with reductions available
when licensing for multiple platforms. In all cases there are no royalties
to pay, and you can use future BASS updates without further cost.

These licences do not allow reselling/sublicensing of BASS. For example,
if a product is a development system, the users of said product are not
licensed to use BASS in their productions; they will need their own
licences.

If the standard licences do not meet your requirements, or if you have
any questions, please get in touch (email: bass@un4seen.com).

MP3
---
MP3 technology is patented, and Thomson license the use of their and
Fraunhofer's patents. The inclusion of an MP3 decoder (eg. BASS) in a
commercial product requires an MP3 patent licence. Contact Thomson for
details:

    www.mp3licensing.com

Alternatively, the "MP3-FREE" BASS version does not include its own MP3
decoder but instead makes use of the operating system's already licensed
decoder. If an MP3 decoder is not available, then MP3 playback will not
be possible, but everything else will function as normal.

NOTE: When using the OS's MP3 decoder, BASS still does the file handling
      so all the usual features are still supported, including streaming,
      tag reading, pre-scanning, gapless playback, etc.

NOTE: Linux does not include an MP3 decoder as standard. The "MP3-FREE"
      BASS version will make use of the libmpg123 decoder, if installed.
